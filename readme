Before generating you have to download several things:

* download splitter [1] and mkgmap [2] and extract the zip-file to directory ./bin

* download boundaries and precompiled sea [3]
	* rename boundary-zip-file to bounds.zip and place it into directory ./data
	* extract precompiled sea-zip to data-folder

#generate_map.sh:
	* generates all the maps
	* recommended to adapt this to your needs and input-files.
	
#proof_style.sh:
	* only needed, if you change the style
	* check, if style rules contains syntax-errors
